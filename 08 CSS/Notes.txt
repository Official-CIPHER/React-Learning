# CSS :-
------------
    Cascading style sheets, It is used to style 
    the user interface.

## There are multiple way to write CSS :-
--------------------------------------------
1. Global CSS - index.css
2. Internal CSS - Inside the page
3. Inline CSS - inside the tag

-> These are some basic way to style the UI.
-> In React, We some other ways to style the UI -
    *1. Different Folder -
     Create Different Folder for styling, and 
    maintain the each component styling in 
    different css file.
      
      ** But there is a problem - When we render all
      the file , they overlaps each other styling.
      ** That why this method also not most preferable.

    *2. Modular Approach -
      Create a separate Folder inside component Folder
      including the jsx and its style in same folder.

        ** How do we import this -
          import styles from './Button.module.css'

          return (
          <div className={styles.btn}>
            This is Button
          </div>)

          ** Now the overlap will not occur.
          ** Use when you want to write and create the 
          separate css for each file.
