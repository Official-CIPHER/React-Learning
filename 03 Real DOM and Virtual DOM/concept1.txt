Real DOM:-
======================== 
  Tree like structure which is used to represent the html tags 
  (Structure)
  
    HTML ->(left side) -> head -> title
    -> (right side) -> body -> header
                        -> section1 -> h1 (changed)
                                -> img
                                -> button (changed)
                        -> section2
                        -> section3

> When we want to clickthe button and change the text , then it
will re- render the entire page.(Browser update the DOM)

    > Problem :-
     1. Update the DOM is slow
     2. Re-rendering large pages cost performance
     3. Every change can cause layout recalculate


Virtual DOM:-
========================
  Virtual DOM is the lightweight copy of Real DOM.
  The Virtual DOM is a Javascript Object that represents the UI.

  HTML ->(left side) -> head -> title
    -> (right side) -> body -> header
                        -> section1 -> h1 (Changed)
                                -> img
                                -> button (Changed)
                        -> section2
                        -> section3

> How react uses it:-
1. State changes
2. React create the new vitual DOM
3. React Comparews it with the old vitual dom (Diffing).
4. React update only the changed parts in real dom. (Reconciliation)

# Diffing :- (spotting the changes)
  Finding what changed
  Compare old Virtual dom with the new vitual dom and find the 
  difference.

# Reconciliation :- (apply the changes)
  Using the Diffing result to update the real dom in the best way.
