#Components :- 
-------------------------------
  -> A reuseable piece of the User Interface (UI).
  
  -> Think of components like building block that together
  make up a web page.

  -> It is a JavaScript function or class that :-
      * Return UI (usually written in JSX).
      * Can receive data (Called props).
      * Can manage its own data (Called State).

  Ex:-
    function Greeting() {
      return <h1>Hello, Good Morning !!</h1>
    }

    You can use components like html tags.

    <Greeting/>


#Types of Components:-
------------------------------
1. Function Components (Most Common ✅)
2. Class Components

## 1. Function Components :-
        * Written as JS Function. 
        * Can use Hooks (Like useState, useEffect).

    Ex:- Function hello(props) {
      return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
    }

    <hello/> -----> Hello, Vishal

## 2. Class based Components :-
        * Written as JS Classes.
        * Use this.state and lifecycle methods.

    Ex:- 
    import React, {Component} from 'react';

    class welcome extends Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
      }
    }

  
# Importance of Components :-
---------------------------------
1. Reusability - use same components multiple times.
2. Modular - easier to manage and organize code.
3. Maintainability - changes affect only that component.
4. Efficient  - React updates only what changes.


  Ex:-
  ## A website can broken into components like
    -> Header   |
    -> Navbar   | \
    -> Sidebar  |   Separate Components
    -> Button   | /
    -> Footer   |
